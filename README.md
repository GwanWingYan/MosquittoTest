# MosquittoTest
This repo is the team codespace for BUPT 2021Spring *Communication Protocol Test* course, which includes many test cases for Mosquitto - a free open software implementing the MQTT protocol. 
It contains two parts of the second course's experiment:
1. A test tool based on *eclipse Paho*.
2. A test tool writen from pure Java without any third-party API.
